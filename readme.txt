This plugin adds a CMS-like tree overview of all your pages to WordPress - like the view often found in a page-focused CMS. 
Within this page tree you can edit pages, view pages, add pages, search pages, and drag and drop pages to rearrange the order.

Page management won't get any easier than this!

#### Features and highlights:

* drag and drop to rearrange your pages
* add pages after or inside a page
* edit pages
* view pages
* search pages
