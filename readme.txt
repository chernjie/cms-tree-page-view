Adds a CMS-like tree overview of all your pages. Edit, view, add pages, search pages, and drag and drop to rearrange the order of your pages.

== Description ==

This plugin adds a CMS-like tree overview of all your pages to WordPress - like the view often found in a page-focused CMS. 
Within this page tree you can edit pages, view pages, add pages, search pages, and drag and drop pages to rearrange the order.

Page management won't get any easier than this!

Please note that this plugin now requires WordPress 3. If you are using WordPress 2.x you can try this old version instead: http://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/cms-tree-page-view.0.4.9.zip

#### Features and highlights:

* drag and drop to rearrange your pages
* add pages after or inside a page
* edit pages
* view pages
* search pages

#### Screencast

== Installation ==

1. Upload the folder "cms-tree-page-view" to "/wp-content/plugins/"
1. Activate the plugin through the "Plugins" menu in WordPress
1. Done!

Now the tree with the pages will be visible both on the dashboard and in the menu under pages.

== Screenshots ==

2. Edit, view and add pages (choices visible upon mouse over).
3. Search pages.
4. Drag-and-drop to rearrange/change the order of the pages.
5. The tree is also available on the dashboard and therefore available immediately after you login.
