Adds a CMS-like tree overview of your pages or custom posts. Rearrange the order of your pages (with drag and drop). Also edit, view, add, and search your pages.

== Description ==

This plugin adds a CMS-like tree overview of all your pages and custom posts to WordPress - much like the view often found in a page-focused CMS, or like Windows Explorer or OS X Finder.
Within this tree you can edit pages, view pages, add pages, search pages, and drag and drop pages to rearrange the order.

CMS Tree Page View is a good alternative to plugins such as [pageMash](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/pagemash/), [WordPress Page Tree](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/page-tree/)
and [My Page Order](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/my-page-order/) .

Page management won't get any easier than this!

#### Features and highlights:

* drag and drop to rearrange your pages
* add pages after or inside a page
* edit pages
* view pages
* search pages
* available for both regular pages and custom posts
* easy view your site hierarchy directly from the WordPress dashboard
* supports WPML, so you can manage all the languages of your site
